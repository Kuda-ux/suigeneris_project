- Step 5 (Documents & Consent): 20%

### 3. **Save & Exit Button** 💾
**Available on all steps**:

- Steps 2-5: "Save & Exit" (colored buttons matching step theme)

**User Flow**:
1. User fills some information
2. Clicks "Save & Exit"
3. Gets confirmation: "✅ Progress saved!"
4. Can safely close browser
5. Returns later - all data is restored

### 4. **Visual Save Notifications** 🔔
**Features**:

- Appears for 2 seconds after auto-save
- Non-intrusive, top-right corner

### 5. **Document Upload Helper** 📸
**Problem**: Users need to take photos of documents but can't leave the form.

**Solution**:
- Helpful message in Step 5: "📸 Need to take photos?"
- Clear instructions: "Click 'Save & Exit', take your photos, then return"
- Reassurance: "Your progress is saved automatically"

**User Journey**:
1. Reaches document upload step
2. Realizes they need to take photos
3. Clicks "Save & Exit"
4. Closes browser, takes photos
5. Returns to form - exactly where they left off
6. Uploads photos and continues

### 6. **Smart Data Persistence** 🧠
**What's Saved**:
- ✅ All text inputs (name, email, phone, etc.)
- ✅ All dropdowns (gender, employment status, bank, etc.)
- ✅ All number inputs (salary, account number)
- ✅ Current step number
- ✅ Selected loan term (6 or 12 months)
- ✅ Selected product/laptop
- ✅ Timestamp of last save

**What's NOT Saved** (for security):
- ❌ Actual file uploads (only metadata)
- ❌ Sensitive data after submission

**Data Cleared**:
- Automatically cleared after successful submission
- Prevents data leakage between applications

### 7. **Progress Bar with Context** 📈
**Display**:
```
Application Progress: 60%
Last saved: 10:45:23 AM
[████████████░░░░░░░░] 60%
🛡️ Your progress is automatically saved. You can close this page and return anytime.
```

**Benefits**:
- Users know exactly how far they've progressed
- Confidence that work is saved
- Motivation to complete application

## 🎯 User Experience Improvements

### Before:
❌ Lost all data if browser closed
❌ Had to complete in one sitting
❌ Couldn't take photos during application
❌ No indication of progress
❌ Frustrating if interrupted

### After:
✅ Data saved automatically
✅ Can complete over multiple sessions
✅ Can leave to take photos
✅ Clear progress indication
✅ Stress-free experience

## 📱 Mobile-Friendly Features

### Responsive Design:
- Progress bar adapts to screen size
- Buttons stack vertically on mobile
- Save notification positioned for mobile
- Touch-friendly button sizes

### Mobile Use Cases:
1. **Photo Taking**: User can exit app, open camera, take photos, return
2. **Multitasking**: Switch between apps without losing progress
3. **Interruptions**: Handle calls, messages without data loss
4. **Battery Saving**: Close browser to save battery, resume later

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### Data Storage:
- Stored in browser's localStorage (client-side only)
- Not transmitted until final submission
- Cleared after successful submission
- No server-side storage of drafts

### File Handling:
- File objects not stored (too large)
- Only metadata saved (filename, upload status)
- Users must re-upload files if they clear browser data

## 💡 Smart UX Patterns

### 1. **Debounced Auto-Save**
- Waits 1 second after user stops typing
- Prevents excessive saves
- Smooth, non-intrusive

### 2. **Visual Feedback**
- Save notification confirms action
- Progress bar shows completion
- Timestamp shows recency

### 3. **Clear Communication**
- Helpful messages at each step
- Instructions for photo taking
- Reassurance about data safety

### 4. **Graceful Degradation**
- Works without localStorage (falls back to session)
- Handles errors silently
- Never blocks user progress

## 🎨 Design Consistency

### Color-Coded Steps:
- Step 1 (Personal): Red/Purple gradient
- Step 2 (Employment): Green/Blue gradient
- Step 3 (Banking): Purple/Pink gradient
- Step 4 (Laptop): Orange/Red gradient
- Step 5 (Documents): Blue/Indigo gradient

### Save Buttons:
- Consistent icon (💾 Save)
- Themed colors matching each step
- Clear, action-oriented text

## 📊 Technical Implementation

### LocalStorage Keys:
```javascript
STORAGE_KEY = 'loan_application_draft'
STEP_KEY = 'loan_application_step'
```

### Auto-Save Logic:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (formData.full_name || formData.email) {
    const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
      saveFormData();
    }, 1000); // Debounce for 1 second
    
    return () => clearTimeout(timeoutId);
  }
}, [formData, step]);
```

### Progress Calculation:
```javascript
const calculateProgress = () => {
  let completed = 0;
  const total = 5;
  
  if (formData.full_name && formData.email && formData.phone) completed++;
  if (formData.employer && formData.net_salary) completed++;
  if (formData.bank_name && formData.account_number) completed++;
  if (formData.product_id) completed++;
  if (formData.data_sharing_consent) completed++;
  
  return Math.round((completed / total) * 100);
};
```

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

3. ✅ Click "Save & Exit" - confirmation shown

7. ✅ Mobile: Switch apps and return - data intact

## 🎯 Future Enhancements (Optional)

2. **SMS Reminders**: Remind users to complete application
3. **Cloud Sync**: Sync across devices (requires backend)
4. **Offline Mode**: Complete application offline
5. **Auto-Fill**: Pre-fill from previous applications

## 📝 User Instructions

### For Users:
1. **Start Application**: Fill in your information
2. **Auto-Save**: Your progress saves automatically every few seconds
3. **Take a Break**: Click "Save & Exit" anytime
4. **Return Later**: Your data will be right where you left it
5. **Complete**: Submit when ready - all data is cleared after submission

### For Support Team:
- If user reports lost data: Check if they cleared browser data
